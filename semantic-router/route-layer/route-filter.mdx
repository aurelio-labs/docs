title: "Semantic Router Filter"
---

We can filter the routes that the RouteLayer considers when making a
classification. This can be useful if we want to restrict the scope of
possible routes based on some context.

For example, we may have a route layer with several routes, politics,
weather, chitchat, etc. We may want to restrict the scope of the
classification to only consider the chitchat route. We can do this by
passing a route_filter argument to our RouteLayer calls like so:

```python
rl("don't you love politics?", route_filter=["chitchat"])
```

In this case, the RouteLayer will only consider the chitchat route
for the classification.

## Full Example

[![Open In Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/assets/colab-badge.svg)](https://colab.research.google.com/github/aurelio-labs/semantic-router/blob/main/docs/09-route-filter.ipynb) [![Open nbviewer](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/pinecone-io/examples/master/assets/nbviewer-shield.svg)](https://nbviewer.org/github/aurelio-labs/semantic-router/blob/main/docs/00-introduction.ipynb)

We start by installing the library:

```ipython3
!pip install -qU semantic-router
```

We start by defining a dictionary mapping routes to example phrases that
should trigger those routes.

```ipython3
from semantic_router import Route

politics = Route(
    name="politics",
    utterances=[
        "isn't politics the best thing ever",
        "why don't you tell me about your political opinions",
        "don't you just love the president",
        "don't you just hate the president",
        "they're going to destroy this country!",
        "they will save the country!",
    ],
)
```

Let‚Äôs define another for good measure:

```ipython3
chitchat = Route(
    name="chitchat",
    utterances=[
        "how's the weather today?",
        "how are things going?",
        "lovely weather today",
        "the weather is horrendous",
        "let's go to the chippy",
    ],
)

routes = [politics, chitchat]
```

Now we initialize our embedding model:

```ipython3
import os
from getpass import getpass
from semantic_router.encoders import CohereEncoder, OpenAIEncoder

os.environ["COHERE_API_KEY"] = os.getenv("COHERE_API_KEY") or getpass(
    "Enter Cohere API Key: "
)
# os.environ["OPENAI_API_KEY"] = os.getenv("OPENAI_API_KEY") or getpass(
#     "Enter OpenAI API Key: "
# )

encoder = CohereEncoder()
# encoder = OpenAIEncoder()
```

Now we define the `RouteLayer`. When called, the route layer will
consume text (a query) and output the category (`Route`) it belongs to
‚Äî to initialize a `RouteLayer` we need our `encoder` model and a
list of `routes`.

```ipython3
from semantic_router.layer import RouteLayer

rl = RouteLayer(encoder=encoder, routes=routes)
```

```default
[32m2024-05-07 16:02:43 INFO semantic_router.utils.logger local[0m
```

Now we can test it:

```ipython3
rl("don't you love politics?")
```

```default
RouteChoice(name='politics', function_call=None, similarity_score=None)
```

```ipython3
rl("how's the weather today?")
```

```default
RouteChoice(name='chitchat', function_call=None, similarity_score=None)
```

Both are classified accurately, what if we send a query that is
unrelated to our existing `Route` objects?

```ipython3
rl("I'm interested in learning about llama 2")
```

```default
RouteChoice(name=None, function_call=None, similarity_score=None)
```

In this case, we return `None` because no matches were identified.

## Demonstrating the Filter Feature

Now, let‚Äôs demonstrate the filter feature. We can specify a subset of
routes to consider when making a classification. This can be useful if
we want to restrict the scope of possible routes based on some context.

For example, let‚Äôs say we only want to consider the ‚Äúchitchat‚Äù route for
a particular query:

```ipython3
rl("don't you love politics?", route_filter=["chitchat"])
```

```default
RouteChoice(name='chitchat', function_call=None, similarity_score=None)
```

Even though the query might be more related to the ‚Äúpolitics‚Äù route, it
will be classified as ‚Äúchitchat‚Äù because we‚Äôve restricted the routes to
consider.

Similarly, we can restrict it to the ‚Äúpolitics‚Äù route:

```ipython3
rl("how's the weather today?", route_filter=["politics"])
```

```default
RouteChoice(name=None, function_call=None, similarity_score=None)
```

In this case, it will return None because the query doesn‚Äôt match the
‚Äúpolitics‚Äù route well enough to pass the threshold.
