## Callback Objects

```python
class Callback()
```

#### aiter

```python
async def aiter() -> AsyncIterator[str]
```

Used by receiver to get the tokens from the stream queue. Creates
a generator that yields tokens from the queue until the END token is
received.

#### start\_node

```python
async def start_node(node_name: str, active: bool = True)
```

Starts a new node and emits the start token.

#### end\_node

```python
async def end_node(node_name: str)
```

Emits the end token for the current node.

#### close

```python
async def close()
```

Close the stream and prevent further tokens from being added.
This will send an END token and set the done flag to True.
